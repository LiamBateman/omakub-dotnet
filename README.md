# Omakub (.Net)

This is a .Net Specific version of Omakub. 

Omakub turns a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. 

Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

For standard Omakub, Watch the introduction video and read more at [omakub.org](https://omakub.org).
